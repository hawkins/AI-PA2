# Required to hand in:

Your evaluation of the various heuristics used in the search.

- For minimum-remaining values and the degree heuristic, modify the code to not use the heuristic and report the how quickly the code can solve puzzles.
- Do the same for the least-constraining value heuristic.
- See how long it takes to solve a single puzzle without any heuristics.
- Specifically report the combination of all these heuristics and functions that solves puzzles the fastest in your implementation.

> (For each of these, you can kill the code if it hasn’t produced a solution in a reasonable amount of time and report that fact. Don’t wait for hours and hours to see if it finally solves something, unless you want to run it overnight for fun, but that is not required.)
